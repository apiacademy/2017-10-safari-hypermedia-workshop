## Why Not Stop at URLs?

### URLs are good enough
* URLs are the easiest to update w/o breaking
* often workflow changes or objets changes are too complicated to typical client apps to adapt
* the same team writing the server is also writing the client

### URLs are not enough
* i can't add fields w/o breaking the client (or requiring updates to the code)
* if you don't write the clients, often they need to adapt more easily to objects and actions, not just addresses
