## Why is Siren Different?

 * Defines Actions
 * defines method, URL, and arguments (client-side validation)
 * HAL defines Addresses (URLs)
 * HAL _can_ describe simple URL templates! (`http://api.example.org/tasks/?search={text}`)
 
### Pros/Cons of including Actions in responses
 * UI designers can lose control of the design/display
 * Code doesn't grow as the list of actions grows
 * Describing Actions takes up lots of space in the message
 * UI Designers have more to deal with when implementing the UI
