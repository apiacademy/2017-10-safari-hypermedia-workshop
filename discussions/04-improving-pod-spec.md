## How Can we Improve the POD Spec Idea?

 * render is true/false, but probably needs to be much more than that
 * "hidden" or "optional"
 * display mask (numbers, currency, phone-numbers, etc.)
 * Order of Appearance
 * How to handle displaying nested data (master-detail, etc.)
 * include type information (text, string, float, etc.)
 * marking a property as readonly, etc. (Action-related)
 
 * Describe the `display schema` (not the object schema)
 
 * POD-type specs are for display/human-oriented work, not always helpful for machine-only (esp. w/ no display)
